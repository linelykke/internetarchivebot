# What is InternetArchiveBot

InternetArchiveBot is a powerful PHP, framework independent, OAuth bot designed primarily for use for WMF Wikis, per the request of the global communities, by Cyberpower678. It is a global bot that uses wiki-specific functions in an abstract class to run on different wikis with different rules. For maximum flexibility, it features on and off site configuration values that can be altered to suit the operator, and/or the wiki community. Its function is to address many aspects of linkrot. For large sites, it can be set to multi-thread with a specified number of workers to get the job done faster. Each worker analyzes its own page, and reports back to the master with the statistics afterwards.

# How it works
IABot has a suite of functions it can do when it analyzes a page. Since the aim is to address link rot as completely as possible, analyzes links in many ways by:

* Looking for URLs on the page rather than the DB. This allows the bot to grab how the url is being used, such as detecting if it's used in a cite template, a reference, or if it's a bare link. This allows the bot to intelligently handle sources formatted in various ways, almost like a human.
* Checking the archives if a link already exists, and if it doesn't request archiving into the Wayback Machine.
* Looking into the archives at the Wayback Machine to fetch a working copy of the page for a link that is dead, or using archives already being used for a URL on Wikipedia.
* Checking if untagged dead links are dead or not. This has a false positive rate of 0.1%.
* Automatically resolving templates that resolve as URLs in citation templates and working from there. The same also applies for templates as access dates.
* Saving all that information to a DB, which allows for the use of interfaces that can make use of this information, and allows the bot to learn, and improve its services.
* Convert existing archive URLs to their long form if enabled.
* Fix improper usages of archive templates, or mis-formatted URLs.

IABot's functions are in several different classes, based on the functions they do. Communication-related functions and wiki configuration values, are stored in the API class. DB related functions in the DB class, miscellaneous core functions in a static Core class, dead link checking functions in a CheckIfDead class, thread engine in Thread class, and the global and wiki-specific parsing functions in an abstract Parser class. While all but the last functions can run uniformly on all wikis, the Parser class requires a class extension due to its abstract nature. The class extensions contain the functions that allow the bot to operate properly on a given wiki, with its given rules. When the bot starts up, it will attempt to load the proper extension of the Parser class and initialize that as its parsing class.

# Installation and Requirements
IABot requires the following to run:

* PHP 7.2.9 or higher with intl, curl, mysqli, mysqlnd, json, pcntl, and tideways/xhprof (optional)
* A tor package from HomeBrew, apt, or some other package handler
* A SQL DB (latest MariaDB recommended)
* Composer from getcomposer.org
* A webserver like Apache

## Using Docker
Using Docker is the quickest and easiest way to install InternetArchiveBot.  If you expect to run the bot on a multitude of wikis, it may be better to break up the install to a dedicated execution VM and a dedicated MariaDB VM.

Docker automatically provides IABot with the needed PHP and MariaDB environment, but does not come with TOR support.  All that is needed is a composer.phar file to install the dependencies.

1. Clone this repo to your desired directory.
2. cd into the root folder of your clone.
3. Run `docker-compose up`, it will take a few minutes for the containers to come up for the first time.
4. Install composer and run a composer install. (Composer requires PHP to run)
5. Navigate to the 'app/src/' folder and rename deadlink.config.docker.inc.php to deadlink.config.local.inc.php
6. Define your configuration values, leaving the preconfiguged values alone.
7. Goto http://localhost:8080/ to complete bot setup.
8. When the bot is set up, you can execute the bot from within docker's command line, by running `php deadlink.php`

## Manual install
Manually installing offers more flexibility, but is more complicated to set up.  This is the recommended method when deploying to a large wikifarm.

1. Decide on whether or not to run the DB on a separate host.
2. Install PHP with required extensions.  You can run `php -m` to check for installed modules, and `php -v` to check it's version.
3. You may optionally install a tor package from your host's package manager.  Tor will work right out of the box, if installed, and shouldn't require any further setup.
4. Install your DB server (MariaDB is recommended) on your desired host.
5. Install your webserver on your host to run IABot.
6. Clone this repo.  For easiest setup, if your webserver loads content from /var/www/html, you can copy the contents of the repo to /var/www.  Refer to step 7 and 8 if you opt to not go this route, else skip to 9.
7. If you opt not to go this route, you may symlink, or move, the html folder of the this repor to the html folder of the webserver.
8. Create `setpath.php` file in the html folder with `<?php $path='/path/to/src/folder/';`
9. cd into the root folder of your clone.
10. Install composer and run a composer install.
11. Navigate to the 'app/src/' folder and copy deadlink.config.inc.php to deadlink.config.local.inc.php
12. Define your configuration values.  If you did steps 8 and 9, you need to define `$publicHTMLPath` as the relative path, relative to the location of the config file, to the html folder of the webserver.  Otherwise, you can just leave it as is.
13. Open a webbrowser to your web server to complete bot setup.
14. When the bot is set up, you can execute the bot by running `php deadlink.php`

## Docker and xDebug
The Docker image is preloaded with xDebug.  It is recommended to use PHPStorm when developing, or debugging, InternetArchiveBot.  PHPStorm comes with Docker support, as well as VCS management, Composer support, and a xDebug support.

# Configuration

As of v2.0, the on wiki pages for configuring IABot are no longer used.  The bot instead is configured with the IABot Management Interface.  All global keywords are still used.

If you are running InternetArchiveBot yourself, you can configure it via the on wiki config page and by creating a new deadlink.config.local.inc.php file in the same directory. If someone else is running InternetArchiveBot and you just need to configure it for a particular wiki, you can set up a subpage of the bot's userpage called "Dead-links.js" and configure it there. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:InternetArchiveBot/Dead-links.js. The configuration values are explained below:

* **link_scan** – Determines what to scan for when analyzing a page.  Set to 0 to handle every external URL on the article.  Set to 1 to only scan URLs that are inside reference tags.

* **page_scan** – Determines what pages to scan when doing it's run.  Set to 0 to scan all of the main space.  Set to 1 to only scan for pages that have dead link tags.

* **dead_only** – Determines what URLs it can touch and/or modify.  Set to 0 to allow the bot to modify all links.  Set to 1 to only allow the bot to modify URLs tagged as dead.  Set to 2 allow the bot to modify all URLs tagged as dead and and all dead URLs that are not tagged.

* **tag_override** – Tells the bot to override its own judgement regarding URLs.  If a human tags a URL as dead when the bot determines it alive, setting this to 1 will allow the tag to override the bot's judgement.  Set to 0 to disable.

* **archive_by_accessdate** – Setting this to 1 will instruct the bot to provide archive snapshots as close to the URLs original access data as possible.  Setting this to 0 will have the bot simply find the newest working archive.  Exceptions to this are the archive snapshots already found and stored in the DB for already scanned URLs.

* **touch_archive** – This setting determines whether or not the bot is allowed to touch a URL that already has an archive snapshot associated with it.  Setting this to 1 enables this feature.  Setting this to 0 disables this feature.  In the event of invalid archives being present or detectable mis-formatting of archive URLs, the bot will ignore this setting and touch those respective URLs.

* **notify_on_talk** – This setting instructs the bot to leave a message of what changes it made to a page on its respective talk page.  When editing the main page, the talk page message is only left when new archives are added to URLs or existing archives are changed.  When only leaving a talk page message without editing the main page, the message is left if a URL is detected to be dead, or archive snapshots were found for given URLs.  Setting this to 1 enables this feature.  Setting this to 0 disables it.

* **notify_error_on_talk** – This instructs the bot to leave messages about problematic sources not being archived on respective talk pages.  Setting to 1 enables this feature.

* **talk_message_header** – Set the section header of the talk page message it leaves behind, when **notify_on_talk** is set to 1. See the "Magic Word Globals" subsection for usable magic words.

* **talk_message** – The main body of the talk page message left when **notify_on_talk** is set to 1.

* **talk_message_header_talk_only** – Set the section header of the talk page message it leaves behind when the bot doesn't edit the main article. See the "Magic Word Globals" subsection for usable magic words.

* **talk_message_talk_only** – The main body of the talk page message left when the bot doesn't edit the main article. See the "Magic Word Globals" subsection for usable magic words.

* **talk_error_message_header** – Set the section header of the talk page error message left behind, when **notify_error_on_talk** is set to 1.

* **talk_error_message** – The main body of the talk page error message left when **notify_error_on_talk** is set to 1.
** Supports the following magic words:
*** *{problematiclinks}*: A bullet generated list of errors encountered during the archiving process.

* **deadlink_tags** – A collection of dead link tags to seek out.  Automatically resolves the redirects, so redirects are not required.  Format the template as you would on an article, without parameters.

* **citation_tags** – A collection of citation tags to seek out, that support URLs.  Automatically resolves the redirects, so redirects are not required.  Format the template as you would on an article, without parameters.

* **archive#_tags** –  A collection of general archive tags to seek out, that supports the archiving services IABot uses.  Automatically resolves the redirects, so redirects are not required.  Format the template as you would on an article, without parameters.  The "#" is a number.  Multiple categories can be implemented to handle different unique archiving templates.  This is dependent on how the bot is designed to handle these on a given wiki and is wiki specific.

* **talk_only_tags** –  A collection of IABot tags to seek out, that signal the bot to only leave a talk page message.  These tags overrides the active configuration.

* **no_talk_tags** –  A collection of IABot tags to seek out, that signal the bot to not leave a talk page message.  These tags overrides the active configuration.

* **ignore_tags** – A collection of bot specific tags to seek out.  These tags instruct the bot to ignore the source the tag is attached to.  Automatically resolves the redirects, so redirects are not required.  Format the template as you would on an article, without parameters.

* **verify_dead** – Activate the dead link checker algorithm.  The bot will check all untagged and not yet flagged as dead URLs and act on that information.  Set to 1 to enable.  Set to 0 to disable.

* **archive_alive** – Submit live URLs not yet in the Wayback Machine for archiving into the Wayback Machine.  Set to 1 to enable.  Requires permission from the developers of the Wayback Machine.

* **notify_on_talk_only** – Disable editing of the main article and leave a message on the talk page only.  This overrides **notify_on_talk**.  Set to 1 to enable.

* **convert_archives** – This option instructs the bot to convert all recognized archives to HTTPS when possible, and forces the long-form snapshot URLs, when possible, to include a decodable timestamp and original URL.

* **convert_to_cites** – This option instructs the bot to convert plain links inside references with no title to citation templates.  Set to 0 to disable.
